Betting patterns
    cyclical / batch (i.e. football)
    trigger based (if a baseball game has odds greater than x)
    continuous / guaranteed
    ??


Parameters to tune:
    Maximum number of bets (if any) per batch (if football)
    % of balance per bet
    strategy



Each investor/bot has:
    a balance
    a sport
    a market (hth, total, spread)
    a maximum number or weekly bets (optional)
    an activation threshhold / trigger for a recovery strategy
        think if balance dips below $xx or if 5 games are lost in a row
    a strategy
        i.e. place a wager on the first 5 bets that meet x criteria
        i.e. after a loss, double the wager. repeat this up to 5 total times, after which point reset to base.
    a model
        a model that has access to historical data and statistics and even relevant news and information (injury reports, etc.) and predicts game outcomes
    a history log
    a list of open wagers
    a forecast (super cool, basically when trained on a similar odds & context game in the past, how accurate was this bot)

Each strategy has:
    a description
    more things... to fill out still


the app needs:
     - backend connection to a machine learning model that uses sports statistics, record information, and historical data alongside current contexts (weather, roster, injuries, home/away, etc) to predict the score and odds on games.
     - api connections to pull relevant news and sports updates to refresh the models
     - a models
     - a basic model
     - a basic strategy (randomly picks?)
     - a performance dashboard that has a heat matrix showing profitability, with the various axises represnting things like model & strategy parameter combinations
    this is such that, as I run various combinations through backtest simulations on historical data, I can both refine the models and figure out the optimum operation for maxmimum profitability
     - a simulation back testing lab, where there's control to modify various model parameters, train ML models, and change bot parameters
