1. Strategies
High-Tech:

Modular Strategy Builder: Let users combine logic blocks visually (drag-and-drop). For example, “If total points > X AND weather is clear, bet Over”.
Parameter Tuning: Allow sliders/inputs for risk level, bet size, frequency, trigger thresholds, recovery logic (Martingale, Kelly, etc.).
AI-Driven Suggestions: Analyze past betting history and recommend strategies tailored to user goals (profit, risk reduction, etc.).
Pre-Built Templates: Offer templates for popular strategies: Value Betting (+EV), Arbitrage, Trend Following, Loss Recovery, etc.
Easy-to-Use:

Strategy Wizard: Step-by-step guided creation (“Pick your sport”, “Choose a risk level”, “Select triggers”, etc.).
Plain Language Descriptions: Always show the strategy in plain English alongside the logic (e.g., “Place an Over bet if predicted score is 8+ points above the sportsbook line”).
One-Click Activation: Users should be able to activate, clone, or pause strategies easily.
2. Models
High-Tech:

Hybrid ML Models: Use deep learning (LSTM, transformer) for time-series sports data, combined with feature engineering (weather, injuries, team morale).
Live Data Ingestion: Real-time feeds for stats, weather, injuries, betting lines, and odds changes.
Custom Model Training: Allow advanced users to upload their own data or tweak model parameters (learning rate, epochs, features).
Explainable AI: Integrate SHAP/LIME plots so users can see which factors influenced a prediction.
Easy-to-Use:

Model Gallery: Show available models with performance summaries and plain-language explanations (“This model is best for NFL totals”).
Auto-Refresh: Models auto-update with latest data; manual “Refresh” button for control.
Quick Compare: Side-by-side comparison of model outputs for the same event.
3. Editors (for Strategies & Models)
High-Tech:

Visual Flow Editor: Node-based interface for building logical flows for strategies and pipelines for models.
Integrated Code Editor: For power users, allow Python/JS scripting with autocomplete and error checking.
Simulate/Test Mode: Preview strategy/model performance with historical data—show hypothetical outcomes and stats.
Easy-to-Use:

Drag-and-Drop Blocks: No coding required for basic users; snap together “If”, “Then”, “Else” blocks.
Undo/Redo History: Safe experimentation.
Preset Inputs: Dropdowns, sliders, toggles for common parameters.
4. Performance Tracker
High-Tech:

Interactive Dashboards: Heatmaps, scatter plots, and time series charts for profitability, risk, win rate, etc.
Cohort Analysis: See how strategies/models performed in specific contexts (rainy games, late season, specific teams).
Profit Attribution: Breakdown by strategy, bot, sport, market, and time period.
Easy-to-Use:

Simple Summaries: “Your NFL bot made $X last month, with 55% win rate.”
Drill-downs: Click to see details for any metric.
Export Options: Excel, CSV, PDF, and sharable links.
Alerts/Notifications: Send push/email if a strategy is underperforming, or if a significant opportunity is detected.
Example User Flows
Casual User: Logs in, picks a sport, selects a pre-built strategy, reviews plain-language summary, activates, and tracks performance on dashboard.
Power User: Customizes strategy/model via editor, uploads data, runs backtest, tweaks parameters, and monitors advanced analytics.
Modern Tech Stack Suggestions
Frontend: React + D3.js/Plotly for rich interactive UI
Backend: Python (FastAPI) for ML, Node.js for orchestration
ML: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch; use HuggingFace for NLP on news/injury reports
Storage: PostgreSQL (structured), Redis (caching), S3 (historical datasets)
APIs: Sports data (Sportradar, The Odds API), weather (OpenWeatherMap), news (NewsAPI)
Auth/User: OAuth (Google, Apple, etc.)
